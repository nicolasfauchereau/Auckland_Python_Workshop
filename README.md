## The Anaconda python distribution

For this tutorial, I **strongly** recommend installing the **Anaconda Python distribution**. It is a completely free *enterprise-ready* Python distribution for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing. It includes the python interpreter itself, the python standard library as well as a set of packages exposing data structures and methods for data manipulation and scientific computing and visualization. In particular it provides [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), etc ... i.e. all the main packages we will be using during the tutorial. The full list of packages is available at:

[http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html)

The Anaconda python distribution (**NOTE**: select the version shipping with Python 3.6) must be downloaded from:

[http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads)

For your platform.

You should not need administrator rights, as Anaconda is completely self-contained and can be installed in your `HOME` directory. I suggest installing `Anaconda` in `/Users/USERNAME/anaconda` on Macs, and `C:\Users\USERNAME\anaconda` on Windows

Once you have installed Anaconda, you can update to the latest compatible versions of all the pre-installed packages by running, at the command line, i.e. in Windows select `Cmd.exe`, on Mac the `Terminal` application in `Utilities`, the `$` sign signifies the command prompt, so do not enter it !, also when prompted `do you want to proceed?` just enter yes (`y`) :   

```
$ conda update conda
```

Then

```
$ conda update anaconda
```

You also might want to install [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to install packages from the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).

```
$ conda install pip
```

## Installation of additional libraries

### netcdf4

[netcdf4](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python) allows you to read and write netcdf files (version 3 and 4 supported), install it by:

```
$ conda install netcdf4
```

### Basemap

**Basemap** is a graphic library for plotting (static, publication quality) geographical maps (see [http://matplotlib.org/basemap/](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)). **Basemap** is available directly in **Anaconda** for Mac and Linux using the conda package manager, install with :

```
$ conda install basemap
```

but on Windows, you'll have to use an alternative channel (conda-forge), the command becomes: 

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge basemap
```

### Cartopy

[**Cartopy**](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) is the second library for making geographical maps that we are going to see. It has been developed by the UKMO, and will eventually replace **Basemap**. However to this date Cartopy does not have all the features present in Basemap.

Cartopy is not available through the anaconda standard channel, to install you need to use the community maintained *conda-forge* channel, with this syntax:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge cartopy
```

### Seaborn

[seaborn](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. You should be able to install it with ```conda``` as well:

```
$ conda install seaborn
```
### xarray

[xarray](https://github.com/xarray/xarray) (previously *xray*) is a library aimed at bringing the power of Pandas to multidimensional labelled arrays, such as the ones usually associated with geophysical quantities varying along time and space dimensions (e.g. [time, latitudes, longitudes], [time, level, latitudes, longitudes], etc) and supports reading and writing netcdf files. It can be installed via `conda`:

```
$ conda install xarray
```

All of this can also be done using the Anaconda Navigator GUI (Graphical User Interface) which looks like below

If you go the `Environments` tab on the left, and select the `root` environment (we will talk about the concept of Python environments later in the workshop) you can then search, select and install available packages, including the ones mentioned above.


## Running the Jupyter notebook

The material of the tutorial is in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). In a nutshell a Jupyter notebook is a web-based (i.e. running in the browser) interactive computational environment where you can combine Python code execution, text, rendered mathematical expression, plots, images, and rich media into a **single document**.

It is in my opinion the best environment when you are doing **exploratory data analysis**, and it allows you to weave comments, background information, interpretations and references along with the code itself, and it can be exported to a variety of formats (HTML, pdf) for sharing with colleagues. I **strongly** recommend spending some time learning about the notebook and its many features.

After uncompressing the archive of the repo (or after cloning it with ```git```), navigate to the `notebooks` directory (containing the ```*.ipynb``` files) and type:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

That should bring up the Jupyter notebook dashboard (looking as below) in your default Browser, you should be ready to go !

## Contents

The following is a brief description of the workshop material content: 



+ `01_test.ipynb`: 

  A simple test Jupyter notebook to test the installation of the main libraries and their version 

+ `02_resources.ipynb`: 

  Some links to interesting resources and topics not covered during the workshop

+ `03_Jupyter_notebook.ipynb`

  Introduction to the main features of the **Jupyter notebook**

+ `04_introduction_Python.ipynb`: Introduction the **basics** of the python language:

  + what's an *interpreted programming language*, what is the python *interpreter*

  + how to write a python script

  + basic Python native data types:
    + dealing with numbers in native Python 
    + dealing with `strings` and their formatting 
    + `lists`, `tuples`, `dictionaries`, ...

  + arithmetic operators (`+. -, *, =`)

  + logical operators (`==, >=, <=, !=`) and how they relate to booleans (`True / False`)

  + control flow structures (`for, if / elif / else, while` etc.)

  + reusing your code: writing *functions*, *modules* and *packages*

+ `05_Numpy.ipynb`: 

  A introduction to Numpy: Numpy introduces in particular a data structure called the `ndarray` (*N-dimensional* array) which can store numerical values. It is the foundational library of the Python  *scientific ecosystem*. In this notebook we'll learn the main principles of manipulating numpy *ndarrays*. While you might actually not spend much time working with numpy itself, it is necessary to understand its basic principles, as (almost) everything else in scientific Python is built on top of `numpy`. We'll see:

  + How to create numpy arrays 

  + indexing, slicing, reshaping, transposing, etc.

  + The main methods and functions in numpy operating on numpy `ndarrays`

+ `06_Scipy.ipynb`: 

  [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org)  is the second pillar of the python scientific ecosystem. Where Numpy introduces a *data structure* (the ndarray), Scipy provides a collection of efficient *scientific algorithms*. These are organized in *submodules*, and cover topics ranging from linear algebra to signal and image processing and optimisation (see [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for list of the submodules and their dedicated tutorial). In this notebook we will focus on **interpolation**, and on some of the **statistical** algorithms and methods that scipy makes available.

+ `07_Pandas.ipynb`

  This is where we're gonna spend quite a bit of time ! [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is **THE** library that you need to use when dealing with *tabular* data, *i.e.* "spreadsheet-like" data, where values are stored in 2D arrays with rows and column labels. It is typically the type of data you find in csv, tab / space delimited or Excel files. In this notebook we'll see first: 

  + The basics of the main data structures in Pandas: the **Series** and the **Dataframe** 
  + How to read from / write to common data files (csv, excel, space delimited, tab delimited etc). It will include how to read from a list of e.g. csv files, and concatenating their data in a Dataframe
  + How to manipulate tabular data in Pandas, from selecting rows / columns to more sophisticated conditional indexing 
  + How to perform complex queries and assignments on Pandas Dataframes
  + How to perform **groupby** operations (*split / apply / combine*)
  + How to deal with Missing Values

  One of the strengths of Pandas is its ability to store, and perform sophisticated operations on, **time-series**: i.e. data that is indexed by dates, dates and times, timestamps, etc. In the second part of the Pandas tutorial we will focus on **time-series manipulation in Pandas**. In particular we'll see: 

  + how to read in and correctly parse files containing date / time information 

  + how to resample time-series 

  + rolling window operations (e.g. moving averages)

  + how to deal with missing values and missing index values

+ `08_xarray.ipynb`: 

  [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) is a library to read / write netcdf files and for the manipulation of multi-dimensional labelled arrays, it is especially handy for *gridded data* varying along *latitudes, longitudes, time, depth, height*, etc. Its design follows closely that of Pandas, meaning that familiarity with Pandas allows to quickly pick up xarray. We'll see how to read, write netcdf files in xarray, and perform a series of common analyses such as: 

  + calculating a climatology 
  + calculating anomalies 
  + going from and to Pandas Dataframes
  + calculating composite anomalies
  + resampling, aggregation, groupby operations

+ `09_plotting.ipynb`:

  In this notebook we'll go over the basics of [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/), the main plotting library in python. This is more or less the equivalent of *numpy* but for plotting: *i.e.* a foundational library of the Python scientific ecosystem, on which a number of — more specialised — plotting libraries have been built. One of these we will briefly go over in particular is [**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), a plotting library handy for statistical plots. A short and non-exhaustive list of plotting libraries in Python is provided covering both static plots (i.e. *plotnine*, *ggplot2*, etc) and interactive plots (*bokeh*, *plotly*, *holoviews*, etc)

+ `10_Mapping.ipynb`: 

  Making maps in Python: a brief overview of [**basemap**](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/), [**cartopy**](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/), and — very briefly, for interactive maps — [**folium**](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium). We'll see also briefly how to read shapefiles (with [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/)), transform into a [geojson](http://geojson.org/) and edit in the browser.
